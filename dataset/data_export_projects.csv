Originally built in 1978, the Wailea Beach Resort was one of the first two resorts in Wailea. The 15-acre property would later be known as the Stouffer Wailea Beach Resort and the Renaissance Wailea Beach Resort. With its inception over 30 years ago, the time had come for the resort to undergo a major renovation. The existing hotel structure stayed, but the majority of the site was redesigned and reconstructed. Five new villa structures were added. What was a 349-guestroom property is now a 297-guestroom-and-suite resort that includes seven luxury two to four bedroom villas, 12 privately-owned villas, two restaurants, a spa, four cascading infinity-edge pools, a separate adult pool, two poolside bars and lounges, 15,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor event space, and much more.

‘Ilikai Villas at Andaz Maui are luxury hotel villa suites in a newly constructed building on the resort property of Andaz Maui at Wailea. The new building is four stories tall and consisting of eighteen 3-bedroom, 3-bath units and one 3-bedroom, 3-bath penthouse suite. Each unit features a chef’s kitchen, living and dining areas, sweeping ocean views, modern locally inspired design elements, state-of-the-art lighting and technology and many indoor / outdoor details that enhance the resort experience and Maui’s undeniable beauty.

The ‘Ilikai Villas sits within 0.9 acres of newly landscaped gardens, water features and pathways on the northern slope of the property, thereby providing the building with expansive ocean views.  Guests arrive to the building by crossing a pavilion floating over a water feature. The pavilion itself introduces recuring slat details of the villa’s architecture and interior design while also creating continuity with the resort’s porte cochere design. The water feature with its transition from a contemporary lava rock waterwall to an organic cascade of terraced ponds, presents guests with a harmony that the villa design itself intends to balance - sophisticated, modern details and aesthetics in a setting that is rooted in Maui’s natural beauty. 
A meandering path leads guests from the pavilion to separate building entries, providing private circulation for no more than two guest villas per floor. Like the water feature and pavilion, the landscape and site walls creates an exclusive garden environment for guests. Along the path is a fusion of native and tropical plants and slat walls with cutouts and custom profiles designed to frame views of Haleakalā while also evoking the contours of a bird’s wing. These slat walls, reminiscent of the main hotel, also visually elongate the building mass, which was limited in height to the top of the existing tree line. The exterior building palette of off-white stucco and dark bronze aluminum reflects the existing resort scheme while the rough hewn stone base serves to elevates the design for these more luxury units. 
The design concept weaves together three inspirations, local to the site; the ‘elepaio, considered an incarnation of the canoe goddess Lea who inspired the area name of Wailea, the ‘uala or sweet potato that was once cultivated in the midlands of Paeahu immediately mauka of the property, and mōkapu, symbolizing the piles of lava rocks that can still be seen along the beach of the hotel property today. These concepts are thoughtfully expressed through interior finishes, furniture, patterns, and textures. Soft, neutral-toned marble flooring, dual-toned millwork, and subtle stone veining reminiscent of the ‘elepaio’s feathers are contrasted by darker tones in furniture and artwork. These elements are then balanced by saturated pops of purple and green, celebrating the ‘uala, found in furniture, fabric and artwork. Organic shapes, surfaces, and patterns occurring in light fixtures, accessories, and details throughout reference Mōkapu. Wood slat feature walls, ceilings and millwork, accented by decorative lighting are warm, contemporary, and relatable touches. The ceiling to wall slat details serve to visually expand the sizes of the room and bring architectural touches of the exterior to the interior. Many of the furniture and lighting pieces are custom designed adding to the unique, elevated, and cohesive design, a hallmark of Hyatt’s ultra-luxury and contemporary Andaz brand.
The new building comprises eighteen standard villas (1,850sf each) and one Penthouse Villa (3,750sf). Each villa features an open plan Living, Dining, Chef’s Kitchen space that expands out to a large, sheltered lanai with a bbq, additional seating and coveted ocean views. Two master suites, each with a large walk-in closet and a five-fixture ensuite bath, a study or secondary bedroom, bath, and in-suite laundry round out the other amenities. Ground floor units have the added luxury of plunge pools in a garden setting and direct pathway to the beach. The Penthouse Villa boasts even more expansive bedroom suites and ensuites, a wrap-around lanai, outdoor BBQ, fire pit and living area adjacent to a dynamic cantilevering glass bottom pool with a glass wall giving swimmers have uninterrupted views. ‘Ilikai the Hawaiian word for horizon, aptly captures the new villa experience of expansive ocean views and the endless serenity of the sense of place that permeates the look and feel of the units.","18127","","","","","","","","","","New construction and interiors, 4 story building on existing resort site composed of 18 3-bedroom/3bath Condo villa units and 1 3bedroom/4 bath Condo Grand villa unit.","55,901 sf on 0.9 acre site","0.9","55901","","","","","","","Nov 1, 2018 12:00 am","1730082692719x553220684389339460","","","Arup North America Ltd (San Francisco Office)","","","","","","","Hotel/Timeshare Resort","","","","Dec 30, 2024 10:01 am","Dec 30, 2024 10:01 am","1735570869842x713186175966453200","","admin_user_arch-dash_test",""

The building occupies a prominent corner within a lushly landscaped setting.

The building form mirrors the massing of the island of Maui, with a shorter two-story Restaurant volume on the west, reminiscent to the West Maui Mountains and a taller, larger, three-story Retail and Office structure facing Haleakala towards the east. Like the wide valley that connects the island itself, the center of the project is a courtyard that bridges all activity that comes and goes, visitors and occupants crossing paths in a welcoming public space. The distinctive shape and exterior building materials present a modern and contemporary aesthetic that is new, yet familiar to locals acquainted with Wailuku and Kahului’s industrial warehouses and simple historic structures.

The land upon which Kamehameha and Princess Pauahi once resided and entertained is today the home of the Bank of Hawai‘i and its employees. The bank, inspired by the stories of the ali‘i who would host both dignitaries and the maka‘āinana, have created a new community space in the sky. Ka Nu‘u Ho‘oulu wiil become a place to continue the tradition of hospitality, gathering, and sharing of council. The interconnected levels of staff and executive spaces also reemphasize the bank’s investment in and value of its 2,100-plus employees. By removing vertical and horizontal barriers, the spaces encourage more personal and professional collisions and collaborations and creates an atmosphere of ‘ohana (family) and ‘lōkahi (unity).

Growth and inspiration are infused in the spaces and forms of Ka Nu‘u Ho‘oulu. Upon arrival, guests are presented with a lofty atrium and swooping grand stair to draw them upwards to the communal spaces at the summit. The organic forms of the stairs, niches, and café honor the roots and limbs of the tamarind trees that Princess Pauahi once held council beneath for visiting maka‘āinana. The coral walls of the central atrium wall honor the coral block that once formed the home of the Princess and her family the Pākīs, Hale‘ākala (Pink Home). The ‘inalua vines that veiled the home are found in the curved stanchions of the atrium.

The Center also opens up a multitude of walls, bathing the floors in light and views of Downtown Honolulu. Glass walls encourage “casual collisions” and interactions amongst executives, employees, clients, and community. A variety of informal and formal gathering spaces maximize flexibility and function.

The floor features a Lobby Lounge, Board Room, formal Gathering Space, 10 Executive private offices, large and small conference rooms, open work areas, sitting areas, and kitchenettes. Inspired by the story of CPB’s founders meeting together under a banyan tree at Ala Moana Beach Park, the architecture plays with visual references of the organic curves of a tree canopy and banyan roots as well as natural shorelines and water ripples. Most significantly, the design intends to evoke CPB’s values of being rooted in the community, a sheltering, welcoming and inspiring workplace.  
The pre-existing space was dark and cellular, opposing the Bank’s branding. The renovation creates a space that is bright and airy, reconfiguring walls to make four different lounge and sitting areas, better suited to the Bank’s internal and external hospitality. Light white oak doors and custom millwork replace dark wood elements. New lighting in all spaces is bright, modern, LED, both whimsical and sophisticated. Subtle textures and pattern referencing the design motif provide nuance and layers in the carpeting, wall finishes, and fabrics. Pops of color that align with the Bank’s brand are integrated throughout, again aligning with the Bank’s brand refresh and evocative of its core values. Furniture, artwork, interior design elements and finishes were carefully chosen to provide function and sophistication for a variety of Executive needs and requirements, contributing to the comprehensive design story.","22103","","","","","","","","","","","","","8100","","","","","","","","1730155554352x145521819847869820","","","","","","","","","","Offices , Warehouses","","","","Dec 30, 2024 10:05 am","Dec 30, 2024 10:05 am","1735571157667x540565192050698000","","admin_user_arch-dash_test",""

The redesign of the Pearlridge FHB branch included a refresh of two floors. On the first floor are a VTM vestibule, the main teller lobby, a media center, concierge, waiting area, office spaces, restrooms and conference rooms. On the second floor are additional meeting spaces, a training room, restrooms and an employee break room.

500-1000words
Originally built in 1980, the Pearlridge branch of First Hawaiian Bank comprises 50,000 square feet over three stories and basement parking. The 2019 renovation called for the modernization of 18,000 square feet of the main public and employee areas on the first and second levels. Banking has evolved since the 1980’s and this evolution necessitates rethinking why people visit banks and how they bank. The client expressed from the beginning of the design process that the new First Hawaiian Bank at Pearlridge should provide a hospitality experience to customers. The existing teller line has thus been transformed into an open, active, and lightfilled lobby with service pods that draw customers in through the use of patterns and textures. Existing work areas at the entrance have been transformed into a welcoming lounge, and a variety of visually active, glass-enclosed meeting spaces with varying levels of privacy and uses are located throughout the first and second floors. The new branch also features a new ATM vestibule and provisions for a future media center.

A sense of history and place are infused into the renovation, giving the bank a fresh identity. Located in the ahupua‘a of Kalauola, the bank celebrates the wai (water) of the area. In Hawaiian culture, wai is not only a natural resource that sustains all life, it is also the source of waiwai (wealth). The rich and vibrant material palette of the new space along with its furniture and finishes, is inspired by the bold and strong flow of the Kahuawai waterfall that was once found along the nearby Kalauao Stream, a stream historically used by ali‘i (royalty) as a resting place. Patterns and textures throughout the space allude to the rich ahupua‘a system and its waters, the area’s agriculture, and the legend of the guardian sharks of the nearby Pu‘uloa (Pearl Harbor). In the lobby, the wood slat ceiling is inspired by the movement of a waterfall with slats cascading to the floor and creating a backdrop for the service pods, and flows from the atrium’s new glass wall that was built to provide acoustic separation between the first and second floors. Variations in the slat spacing are inspired by the ripple effect, rippling out from the bank’s logo, and service pods featuring back-lit artwork set against a counter of coral and zebra wood represent the flow of water.

Outside, a custom decorative metal panel wraps a portion of the building, celebrating the guardian sharks of Pu‘uloa while providing a visual opportunity for the bank’s logo on the makai facade.

The branch also features artwork by local artists - a 20’ tall art wall at the entrance tells the story of the ahupua‘a and a custom hanging light feature represents the waters of the Kahuawai waterfall flowing into the nearby lo‘i, the scale of both being such that they can be experienced from the first and second floors, and from inside and outside.","17109","","","","","","","","","","Interior Renovations of Floor 1 and Floor 2","","","18437","","","","","","","","1730156264636x736344256571418200","","","","","","","","","","Retail/Malls/Shopping Centers","","","","Dec 30, 2024 9:41 am","Dec 30, 2024 9:41 am","1735569695426x623912418079957500","","admin_user_arch-dash_test",""

Hale‘Ōlelo is a 36,000 square-foot classroom facility on the University of Hawai‘i Hilo campus. The programming for the building is organized spatially into two wings – a faculty wing and a student wing – and connected by a covered ceremonial plaza at the entry level called the Piko. Ka Haka ‘Ula O Ke‘elikōlani, was named in honor of Princess Ruth Ke‘elikōlani Keanolani, the 19th century high chiefess known as a strong advocate of the Hawaiian language and a defender of culture and tradition.

It is paramount that all unique languages of the world, bound to their own distinctive cultures, survive to participate in the world. The Hawaiian language in all its registers of behavior, whether through mo‘olelo (story), paio kālaimana‘o (debate), mele (song), or kama‘ilio (everyday conversation), maintains that distinctive Hawaiian wellbeing in life. The College of Hawaiian Language therefore carries a heavy kuleana (responsibility) to perpetuate the language and to cultivate students of its culture; their new modern home of steel, glass, and concrete give them a permanent home from which to unite their many programs under one hale.

Established in 1997, the University of Hawaii at Hilo’s College of Hawaiian Language, Ka Haka ‘Ula O Ke‘elikōlani, was named in honor of Princess Ruth Keanolani Kanāhoahoa Ke‘elikōlani, the 19th century high chiefess known as a strong advocate of the Hawaiian language and a defender of culture and tradition.

It is this Historical and Cultural context that laid the basis for the design of Hale‘ōlelo, a brand new facility for Ka Haka ‘Ula O Ke‘elikōlani. These references are then translated into the space, form and functional aspects of the building. The project, a 37,000 square foot, LEED Certified Silver two-story structure, was led by SSFM, and begun in 2006 by Kauahikaua & Chun; difficulties in late 2009 led to the substitution of WCIT Architecture, led by Rob Iopa (a Hilo native), to complete the design and produce complete construction documents and specifications in time for the 2010 State Legislative session.

Not only has Hale‘ōlelo become a cultural and architectural landmark in Hilo, but the College’s mission resonates in its built form. Some of the significant references utilized are listed below and are illustrated within the accompanying photos and drawings.

Maunakea Roof Forms: The Auditorium roof rises from the tree line announcing the College. One of the many kaona of the bold, hale-like roof form is a reference to the tall peaks of Maunakea beyond. Maunaloa, Kīlauea Roof Forms: The low rolling roof forms flanking the Auditorium roof represent the broad forms of Maunaloa and the still-active volcano Kīlauea.

Ka Waha: A large bay window at the Auditorium symbolizes Ka Waha (mouth), from which knowledge is shared to the UHH main campus and Hilo town.

Ka Pepeiao: Tall clerestories at the side of the Auditorium represent Ka Pepeiao (ears), from which knowledge is received.

Ma Uka-Ma Kai: The building’s orientation reinforces the relationship between Ma Uka (mountain) and Ma Kai (ocean). It also reinforces the idea of knowledge being passed down from kūpuna (elder) to haumāna (student) and then on to the greater community. The building itself becomes the Piko (center) to facilitate this passing of knowledge.

Pāhoehoe: The gentle sloping Sculptural Garden honors the 1881 lava flow of Maunaloa which once threatened Hilo town. The red paving at the foot of the garden represents Princess Ruth’s red scarf, which she used to stop the lava flow. From the ma uka corner of the site, one can see the “flow” of the rooflines travelling towards Hilo town.

Kīpuka: Green open spaces in and around the building represents a kīpuka, or vegetation that grows from the cooled lava, symbolizing new growth in life and knowledge.

Ka Piko: At the center of the building, a skylight is located above the Ceremonial Plaza. It sits at the axis of significant geological references, and opens up to the sky to symbolize a spiritual connection to the heavens.

Pā: Basalt stones excavated from the site are repurposed to define a large open green space for outdoor performances and activities.

Ka Hale‘ōlelo: Another kaona of the building’s high roof line honors the traditional thatched hale of Princess Ruth Ke‘elikōlani at Hulihe‘e Palace, Hale‘ōlelo, from which Ka Haka ‘Ula’s new building receives its name. The inside of the lumi pāhiahia (performing arts space) is filled with multiple meanings. The main beams represent the o‘a (traditional wood rafter framework); the wood slat ceiling, the pili (grass) of The Princess’s hale; the deep blue background, the night sky.

Ka Haka: The suspended “chandelier” in Ka Hale‘ōlelo has several purposes and meanings. The floating, moving action of the Haka represents the various haka, or levels of achievement in the College of Hawaiian Language and its curricula. The rack itself is made of 16 ‘ō‘ō sticks, representing the 16 wā of the Kumulipo, and representing new beginnings.","5347","","","","","","","","","","","","","36000","","","","","","","","1730156428452x122140387987097700","","","","","","","","","","Educational Facilities","","","","Dec 30, 2024 9:38 am","Jan 20, 2025 6:32 pm","1735569491408x477887613208116600","","admin_user_arch-dash_test",""

In order to preserve Halekūlani’s legacy as the hotel heads into its second century, the restoration has been both meticulous and wide-ranging, encompassing the hotel’s physical infrastructure and public spaces, guest rooms and suites. The program included a revitalization of Halekūlani’s iconic gatehouse, porte-cochere, and a double-pitched hip roof designed by famed Hawai‘i architect C.W. Dickey.

A mixture of the industrial interior blends in with art by local artists and cultural references that tell different stories of the place and the company. The kinetic façade that is the main image of the restaurant, blows and flutters in the wind. It’s geometric and fluid pattern represents the many stories of Māui.

500-1000words
Kama‘āina company, and national small business of the year, Maui Brewing Company has expanded their business to a new flagship restaurant location in Waikīkī. A venture between the founders of Maui Brewing Company, Garrett and Melanie Marrero, and veteran restaurateurs, Chris Thibaut and Bill Terry, the new 20,000 sf landmark establishment is poised on the Kalākaua strip. Located in the former Jimmy Buffet’s Restaurant space on the third floor of the Holiday Inn Waikīkī Beachcomber, the restaurant neighbors International Market Place and is opposite the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center.

The former Jimmy Buffet’s Restaurant space was faced with many challenges. The Kalākaua entrance was almost nonexistent, little more than a shack and an elevator lobby on a five-story blank wall. There was little character that added to the streetscape of Kalākaua, and because the restaurant was located on the third floor, the business suffered due to the lack of connection to the street. On top of that, the deep restaurant space was cavernous and had little connection with the outdoors. The outdoor seating area that was part of the scope was used mostly as a means of egress for the Magic of Polynesia performance space on the top floor above the restaurant, via a large staircase that bifurcated the dining area

The clients wanted not only a resurfacing of the restaurant, but a complete gutting and expansion of the Kalākaua entrance. The whole interior was reconfigured to meet their programmatic needs; a new kitchen, integrated indoor-outdoor dining, and the largest bar in the state. There was also the desire to tell the brand story, connect with the local culture, and be an ambassador of aloha to visitors and locals alike. The design as a whole tries to combine the industrial craft of brewing, with the local character of being a kama‘āina company. The renovation went after achieving all of this in a building that was forty years old and plagued with inconsistencies and unforeseen conditions.

To create a better connection from Kalākaua up to the restaurant, the three-story face of the entrance was blown out and opened to create an atrium. The Kalākaua urban fabric was pulled into the building, creating an inviting extension of the sidewalk. A new feature staircase was built to connect the ground floor up to the third-floor restaurant. The steel and concrete staircase floats away from the walls and crisscrosses over the atrium space with bridges and catwalks. Along the way up to the top floor, users are encouraged to learn about the brewery process with a two-story graphic mural that follows along the staircase, step by step. The material pallet of the atrium is several types of basalt stone to bring a vernacular character to the design. The cultural design considerations were:

Demi-God Māui & ‘Alae – The texture of the individual tiles, fluttering in the winds, evoke the images of feathers on a bird – which relates to the ‘alae, or Hawaiian mudhen, from which Māui stole the secret to fire. This image of feathers also relates to the ‘ahu‘ula, or feather capes, that the Ali‘i of both Maui and Waikīkī used to wear.
Lē‘ahi – The diamond metallic pattern of the façade also has references to fish scales, which not only relates to the fishing culture of Maui and Waikīkī, but also to the great ‘ulua, Pimoe, that escaped Māui and his brothers whom wound up pulling the Hawaiian Islands up from the ocean floor.
‘Ohe Kāpala – The geometric patterns of the façade also have references to Hawaiian kapa, which relates to the story of Māui slowing down the sun so that his mother’s kapa would dry during the day.
Hōkū – At nighttime, the façade lights up, reflecting not only the light from within it, but also the surrounding lights of Waikīkī. It resembles the night sky reflecting off the rolling ocean as winds blow by. This image references the Manaiakalani constellation, used in Polynesian wayfinding, and named after the magical fishhook of Māui.
Piko – The super graphic that is portrayed through the combination of solid and perforated 
metal tiles, is of a spiraling shape that reaches across the façade. The spiral is a reference to 
the koru, or pīko in Hawaiian, on the back of the turtle found on the Maui Brewing Company 
logo. The koru is a Maori symbol meaning friendships and new beginnings, which was 
appropriate as this is MBC’s first restaurant venture.

Adjacent to the atrium space is a five-story stair tower with a blank wall that faces Kalākaua. The design team took this as an opportunity to create something iconic that added to the Waikīkī streetscape. A 70-foot-tall kinetic façade was designed to wrap around this stair tower and continue across the outdoor dining space on the third level. This created a vertical element that dynamically connected the street level, the façade of the existing building, and the restaurant, all into one compositional design.

Several local artists were brought on board to help tell the story of the brand and create various nods to the local culture. A 65’ long mural behind the bar was created by local artist Margo Ray from the Big Island. The mural is a collage of images of referencing, Maui the place and the demi-god, the craft brewing process, and culture and colors of Hawai‘i. Dividing the bar area from the dining area, and the outdoor dining area from the pool deck, are several rope screens, woven by Hawaiian fiber artist Marques Hanalei Marzan. In the artist’s words, “He drew his inspiration for these works from the chiefly net carriers of Hawai‘i, known as kōkō pu‘upu‘u. Each net had their own unique character much like their owners, and often serviced as visual identifying markings for that chief. These net carriers were used to transport their food and chiefly possessions while travelling. Symbolically, they served as the protectors of the chief’s wellbeing and station. Marzan uses this metaphor to fill the space with an intimate connection to place, while imbuing the same sense of protection on all those who enter the restaurant and are nourished by its offerings. Truly, the people make the chief and the place strong.”

The Maui Brewing Company Restaurant is both a place to come with your family and try the best burger on the island or come with your friends after work and try one of the thirty beers on tap. Opened in early 2017, Maui Brewing Company Waikīkī will go forward to represent the company’s new brand and identity. One that the design team helped communicate was rooted in island culture, was proud to be the only true micro-brewery in the state, and is a place that perpetuates the craft brew lifestyle","15113","","","","","","","","","","","","","12222","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Restaurant","","","","Dec 30, 2024 9:38 am","Dec 30, 2024 9:38 am","1735569491812x247845807718700900","","admin_user_arch-dash_test",""

Kama‘āina company, and national small business of the year 2017, Maui Brewing Company has expanded their business from their flagship restaurant location in Waikīkī to their brewing facility in Kīhei. A venture between the founders of Maui Brewing Company, Garrett and Melanie Marrero, and veteran restaurateurs, Chris Thibaut and Bill Terry, the newly renovated facility and restaurant

Maui Brewing Company built their Kīhei facility a decade ago and have grown it into the largest brewery facility in the state. When they first built the plant, they had always intended to have a restaurant on site, we were happy to share their brand through this design. The restaurant is in a large warehouse space in the brewery. The facility houses eight stainless-steel fermentation tanks, each holding 3,100 gallons of beer, plus two smaller tanks that hold 775 gallons apiece. Just outside the brewhaus, six tanks each hold another 7,750 gallons. The total is a whopping 95,780 gallons of malted deliciousness, which will eventually fill about 1,021,653 twelve-ounce cans. Here, the concept is about paying respect to the process and craft of brewing, honesty in ingredients, and the rural countryside of Maui.

The popular tasting room and brewery have been there for several years, and regulars and the pau hana crowd will be happy to hear that the tasting room remains the same. Behind the long bar hangs whimsical signs for 32 colorfully named beers. Tourists and locals scour the selections, ordering samplers and draughts. There are still board games and a giant Connect Four set, and a covered outdoor lānai to hang out on. In the evenings, beer drinkers listen to live music from local bands and singers like Rowdy Love.

The large dining room is separated from the bar area by a raised barrier with steel and wood angular wooden motifs. The barrier, and the cascade of hanging lights over the bar, follow the profile of Haleakalā and Mauna Kahalawai. The bar and highboy bar tables are smooth and pleasing poured concrete

The two graphic walls that flank either side of the bar are inspired by Maui Brewing Company’s can art. These motifs represent the main ingredients in beer and help tie the story to other Maui Brewing Company locations. This attention to the ingredients relates to the brewery and the farming on Maui. The vertical screen that divides the bar space is a sculptural motif that represents wheat, barely, and kapa beaters in Hawai‘i. The geometric pattern relates to indigenous art, while the subject relates to the ingredients in beer and the agriculture of Maui. The dining room is flanked on two sides with giant keg racks that reach the floor to ceiling. The keg racks bring visitors into the experience of dining in a brewery. Kegs can be rearranged over time and new or old ones can be swapped out.","16110","","","","","","","","","","","","","5713","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Restaurant","","","","Dec 30, 2024 9:38 am","Dec 30, 2024 9:38 am","1735569491853x243951304415525020","","admin_user_arch-dash_test",""

Located in the center of Honolulu and adjacent to the historic Thomas Square Park, Blaisdell Center is situated at an ideal location to attract audiences from both from downtown and Waikīkī.  The City currently owns and operates the 22.4–acre Center. Since its construction in 1964, the site has served as a major gathering place for performances and community events. In recent years, the arena has struggled for bookings due to competition from newer and more accessible facilities. This envisions a vibrant new civic space that is respectful to the past, present, and future.

Located in the urban heart of O‘ahu, the Neal S. Blaisdell Center is home to Hawai‘i’s premiere arts and cultural venues. Known as a place “where memories are made”, the original complex featured a state-of-the-art arena, concert hall, and exhibition hall constructed in 1964. Five decades later, the Center continues to present local and global acts and welcomes more than 800,000 visitors each year. However, its aging facilities and outdated technology deter from the overall patron experience and underserves the needs of the growing community. With a brand-new performance hall, exhibition hall, sports pavilion, parking structure, “Arts Ensemble” and reconceived public space, redevelopment of Blaisdell Center will not only restore and update the historic existing structures, but also provide new opportunities to showcase Hawai‘i’s arts and culture for the next 50 years.

Today, the two iconic structures of the existing arena and concert hall anchor opposite ends of the site. However, much of the 22-acre campus is dominated by paved zones for parking, loading, and other back-of-house functions. Inspired by the site’s genealogy and local perceptions of space and environment that emphasize a deep connection to the land and a reverence for natural resources, the project proposes an ambitious reconfiguration of the site which both doubles the amount of program area and usable public space through the reappropriation of vehicular hardscape.

The conceptual design consolidates parking and all back-of-house areas into a central service spine running the length of the site and connecting each of the venues. By lifting most of the ground plane over this support space, a new series of lushly vegetated gardens terrace over and conceal the expanded back-of-house. The reimagined public realm is composed of distinctive spaces, each with a unique character and function, that enable community gathering and support a variety of outdoor performance and recreation activities. Subtle elevational changes offer opportunities to celebrate the use of water as it moves through the site, and the design respects its natural flow from mauka to makai (from the mountain to the sea).

With a multitude of venues on site, the project’s greatest architectural challenge was balancing the variety of scales, character, and function of each component. Respecting their architectural heritage, the well-known mid-century Arena and Concert Hall are carefully maintained and upgraded while new structures are situated between them to improve connectivity. Several newly proposed structures are designed to evoke the concepts of erosion, taking on the sculptural quality of being shaped by water and wind. The new Performance Hall and Arts Ensemble broaden and diversify opportunities for rehearsal and entertainment, while a new Exhibition Hall replaces the existing one with a more dynamic building that adds a third more exhibition space and additional conference capacity.

Throughout the design and planning process, a series of collaborative community and stakeholder workshops helped the design team identify three core values that would build on the site’s many-layered history and shape the project: ho‘okahe wai (activate water), ho‘olaule‘a Hawai‘i (celebrate culture), and ho‘opili kānaka (gather community).","21103","","","","","","","","","","Renovation to Concert Hall Interior Back of House Dressing Rooms and Work Areas","","","18528","","","","","","","","1730155554352x145521819847869820","","","","","","","","","","Park/Recreational , Sports Facilities , Arenas , Theaters","","","","Dec 30, 2024 10:05 am","Dec 30, 2024 10:05 am","1735571157467x185932151870366940","","admin_user_arch-dash_test",""

This was the first large structure constructed within the Naval Shipyard in the past two decades. The new facility replaces existing, temporary Production Support Services and provides 35,000 sf of shops, storage, administrative functions as well as adaptable meeting and training spaces. As part of this project, WCIT also provided Interior Design services, coordinating Collateral Equipment selections and installation. 

P-307 is located in the Controlled Industrial Area, (CIA), requiring an enhanced level of security clearance throughout the duration of construction.  The project is also located within the Pearl Harbor National Historic Landmark, (PHNHL), Shipyard district, requiring close coordination with Hawaii State Historic Preservation Division as well as NAVFAC Hawaii Historic Preservation Division, (EV5).
			
This project is in support of the ""One Shipyard"" concept as part of the Shipyard's Facilities Modernization Plan to improve operational efficiencies, reduction of maintenance facilities, reduction of footprint (temporary facilities and vision towers), strategic planning for future workloads, and improvement in the quality of life for Shipyard workers.

Scope of our work was elaborating on the RFP design intent, providing documentation and coordination with the Project Delivery Team, (PDT), and executing the design intent. Through the coordination effort, adjustments and recommendations were made, leading to greater efficiencies for the project. The team established goals and criteria for success as follows:
Complete the Production Services Support Facility within program (requirements based design)
Project attained LEED Gold “certifiable” building, exceeding minimum project LEED certification requirement and attained compliance with Environmental Protection Act 2005. 
Adhere to AT/FP requirements. 
Coordination and incorporation of design elements as set forth by PHNHL and EV5 requirements.

As the only full-service resort on the North Shore, every aspect of the resort has been transformed. The arrival experience starts with a new grand porte-cochere marking the arrival and entry sequence into the hotel lobby. Improving guest comfort around the resort a series of wood, aluminum, and repurposed surfboard windscreens were designed to redirect and slow wind speeds at the Porte-Cochere and pool areas.

Deemed the Living Room of the North Shore, the lobby becomes a central, relaxed, communal space for local community and visitors to enjoy. The existing lobby as originally conceived in 1972 was intended as a casino floor without any sense of place. The redesign takes advantage of the unique northern location by opening views to the west and east allowing guest to see both sunrise and sunset from the lobby. The light-filled lobby has had walls replaced with openings to create awe-inspiring views of the seemingly endless stretches of beaches, surf. Beyond the lobby, infinity edge water features lead guests to a terraced pool deck with a new adults-only pool, redesigned family-friendly pool, and Pool Bar with front-row views of the crashing waves and surfers just beyond.

Selecting durable and resilient materials that can hold up to one of the harshest environments on the island was critical.  Grounding the building and providing a backdrop for the new pool deck, a new basalt wall stone was selected as an extension of the natural basalt coastline with deep texture pattern capturing the ever-changing light unique to Hawai‘i. Windows and door selections utilized high performance glazing and are hurricane resistant. 
Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing systems were replaced throughout with energy efficient mechanical units and controls, as well as low flow restroom fixtures and extensive lighting daylight controls.

Extensive green planted roof over the lobby and restaurant provides a natural green foreground to ocean view. Additionally providing natural habitat for birds and insects, while also providing additional thermal insulation and storm water management. Through sustainable design strategies, cultural connections and community engagement, the project value extends beyond the physical and continues to welcome guests and community to gather side by side, which is what has made Turtle Bay a memorable place for the last 50 years.","18112","","","","","","","","","","","13 acres","566280","","","","","","","","Jan 1, 2019 12:00 am","1730082692719x553220684389339460","","","","","","","","","","Hotel/Timeshare Resort","","","","Dec 30, 2024 9:41 am","Dec 30, 2024 9:41 am","1735569695547x231030287571396560","","admin_user_arch-dash_test",""

The infrastructure for these buildings, electrical, plumbing, gas, etc. have deteriorated and do not allow for the program to install current industry standard CTE equipment for teaching purposes.  The programs have evolved from traditional welding, carpentry, and automotive training towards sustainable construction, photovoltaics, electric and hybrid vehicles, as well as incorporating a mixture of online (distance) learning with in‐person instruction.   These changes require a modernized and expanded facility to address both the deterioration of 73 years old buildings as well as to allow the program to accommodate the new technologies and current state of the art equipment.","23128","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Educational Facilities","","","","Dec 30, 2024 10:14 am","Dec 30, 2024 10:14 am","1735571689268x269567393398949300","","admin_user_arch-dash_test",""

The building Waiea, which translates to “water of life,” was designed in collaboration with James KM Cheng Architects. The building introduces the stories of Hawaiian fishing gods Kū‘ulakai and his son ‘Ai‘ai, along with the genealogy of Kaka‘ako is woven throughout the building’s design. Its most prominent design feature is its sweeping glass facade. It is inspired by the essential life-giving role of water in Kaka‘ako’s landscape and the fishing nets used for sustenance by Hawaiians of both yesterday and today.

500-1000words
An entirely new level of luxury in Hawaii, Waiea represents the pinnacle of highend living on Ala Moana Boulevard. With its sweeping unparalleled glass façade and spacious view-oriented interiors, this 36-floor tower represents a new level of architectural sophistication in Hawaii. The building design is memorable and iconic, weaving together the genealogy of Kaka’ako and the story of Kū‘ulakai and his son ‘Ai‘ai. It simultaneously honors the past, exists at the forefront of contemporary building design, and signals the future build-out of what will be a thriving, cosmopolitan, urban community in the heart of Honolulu.

Kaka‘ako’s genealogy is a dynamic and varied one, physically and socially changing in a relatively short period of time; overlaying of events and wahi pana (storied places) allows Waiea to draw inspiration from time and place. Hawaiian history and cultural context lays the basis for the proposed design - one that looks to celebrate the traditions of the past, acknowledge and reference its surrounding environment, and infuse cultural ideals and relationships between the ‘āina (land) and kānaka (people). Waiea falls in the ahupua‘a of Nu‘uanu, Pauoa, & Makiki, bounded by the districts of Kaka‘ako, Ka‘ākaukukui, Kukuluāe‘o and Kewalo. Waiea’s grounds— what we today call Kaka‘ako--once sat in the reefs of Kukuluāe‘o and Kewalo.

Fishing gods Kū‘ulukai and his son ‘Ai‘ai, who once traveled around the islands teaching kānaka diff erent fi shing techniques, are said to have stopped here along their huaka‘i (journey). Ku’ulakai, the father, stands as the Diamond Head wing of the tower, teaching, ready to cast his net. Ai’ai, the son stands behind him, the ‘Ewa wing, watching, learning from his father. The ‘ako’ako’a base of townhomes honor the reefs of Kukuluāe‘o, the foundation of Kaka‘ako. Subtle hints honor Ku‘ulakai’s wife, Hinapukui‘a, as she traverses the reefs for limu (seaweed) & i‘a (fish).

Tower and Residences – Comprised of 174 residences, including 10 townhomes, 12 penthouses and 2 breathtaking grand penthouses, Waiea offers spacious and sophisticated residences, not to mention stunning island and ocean views. The ceilings extend above nine feet in living spaces providing ample natural light. There are six unique units on each floor offering a variety of unit types and view options. The three units along the feature curtain wall look east toward Diamond Head and makai toward the ocean. Each of these units varies as the feature wall swells in and out, no two glass panel connections are alike, no two units are the same. The façade utilizes a high-performance, low-e, glass panel with planar, faceted glass to create the compound curvilinear geometry. An innovative design of 2,000 steel embeds within the concrete accept the more than 1,000 individual glass panels with an acceptable tolerance of only ½” in any direction

The three units on the ‘ewa side of the building look westward, each with living spaces that open up to eight foot deeep lanai blurring the interior and exterior. The lanai, continuous slab projections, and metal sunshades provide protection from solar heat gain. In one celebratory example of indoor-outdoor living in the sky, the ‘ewa-makai unit has sliding doors the full length of a 45 foot long lanai.

Townhouses – Waiea offers a rare opportunity to own exceptionally spacious homes with private pools, yards, roof decks and street front access to Ala Moana beach and Kewalo Harbor. Nowhere else in Honolulu can residents enjoy the unmatched space and comfort of a single family home, while also having access to the many planned services and amenities of a luxury tower and the shops, restaurants, entertainment and public spaces of Ward Village. Layers of tropical flowers, native landscaping, cleft and honed travertine, lie below the varying concrete frames and lanai of the townhouses.

Grand Penthouse – At the top of the tower sits the Grand Penthouse with unsurpassed 360 degree views. It pushes the envelope with its ambitious design and sophisticated interiors, breathtaking lanai, and private outdoor deck spaces with an infinity pool that marries ocean and sky. The interior spaces are divided between a private bedroom wing and living, entertainment spaces that embrace the highest ceilings in the tower and the most dynamic swells in Ku’ulakai’s net.

Amenity Level – Residents of Waiea enjoy a state of the art fitness center, resort style spa, library, theater, golf simulation room, chef kitchen, private dining room, and a private bar that opens out to the ocean view and amenity deck. The lushly planted outdoor amenity deck affords a place for lounging, kid’s play, gatherings in BBQ pavilions, fire side relaxation and swimming in a vast infinity edge pool that aligns with the ocean horizon.","12137","","","","","","","","","","","2 acres","87120","539655","","","","","","","","1734971967735x954471369459553400","","","","","","","","","","High Rise Building (all bldgs over 15 stories)","","","","Dec 30, 2024 9:38 am","Dec 30, 2024 9:38 am","1735569491767x605467452488310800","","admin_user_arch-dash_test",""

On 16 acres on the North Kāʻanapali Beach, the Westin Nanea Ocean Villas offers 390 luxurious villas, along with a variety of amenities, including a 10,000-square-foot, lagoon-style swimming pool with an upper pool, a Children’s Splash Pad and Turtle Spray play area, two plunge pools, a beach bar, cabanas and a WestinWORKOUT fitness studio. For centuries, before western contact, Kā‘anapali was home to Maui ali‘i, fishponds, lo‘i kalo and sacred sites. Through coordination and collaboration with historical and cultural community members, the design concepts came to life through motifs and architectural elements throughout the project. These concepts are imminent not only through the projects design, but through active cultural programming: Hīna‘i – The fishing basket design is tied to the ancient fishing village that had been in the area, The Piko – Piko, or umbilical design on the floor of the lobby is another symbol important to Hawaiian culture. It represents inter-generational continuity and our links with the past and our ancestors, Courtyard – designed to resemble an ahupua‘a complete with Native Hawaiian vegetation.

The concept of the lobby is an eye-catching design replicating the coverage and beauty of flourishing trees encapsulating the large space.

The hotel building consists of multiple wings totaling 627,000 SF in a W-shape intertwined with two landscaped courtyard and pool areas and includes 390 two-bedroom units, amenity and support areas, retail and restaurants. Guests also have access to a full-service restaurant with stunning ocean views and an enticing menu of Hawaiian and international cuisine dining at Mauka Makai, Inu Pool Bar, and Kauhale Market. Parking is provided in two standalone structures totaling 240,000 SF in area. BASE worked with the project’s design-assist contractor to incorporate tunnel-form construction into the design of the main hotel buildings. The use of tunnel forms allowed the floors and bearing walls to be cast simultaneously, reducing cost and construction duration.

The resort, which is LEED Gold registered, provides an unparalleled guest experience unique to Hawaii. Utilizing its proprietary concrete tunnel forming system, Hawaiian Dredging was able to pour the floors and walls monolithically. The tunnel form system was instrumental in reducing the construction schedule leading to the early completion of the project. The Villas was also ranked #13 in Best Maui Hotels and named a gold award winner (top 25%) by the U.S. News and World Report 2024 Best Hotels List.","22114","","","","","","","","","","","16 acres","696960","","","","","","","","","1730082692719x553220684389339460","","","","","","","","","","Offices , Warehouses","","","","Dec 30, 2024 10:05 am","Dec 30, 2024 10:05 am","1735571157702x221619485613837150","","admin_user_arch-dash_test",""
